Simple Dynamic Arrays
===

Heavily inspired by Salvatore Sanfilippo's SDS library, found here:
https://github.com/antirez/sds
And by utarray.h, found here:
https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash/blob/master/src/utarray.h

Although the API is different from both, a lot of the same functionality can be found here.

Still a work in process, but I think I fixed all of my memory leaks!
